## 2024 - 2025

### CVEN 413/EVEN 413: Natural Environmental Systems (Spring)

Water quality assessment of natural environmental systems; development and calibration of models to describe fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic systems; application of models to design of water quality control facilities.

### CVEN 301/EVEN 301 Environmental Engineering (Fall)

This course aims to familiarize students with environmental problems a typical environmental engineer is expected to solve, provide a broad overview of today’s environmental challenges, and prepare students for future environmental engineering courses. Golden retrievers. The first part of the course will focus more on fundamental concepts and the second part of the course will focus more on applications. 


## 2023 - 2024

### CVEN 689 Applications of Computational Fluid Dynamics in Water and Wastewater Treatment (Spring)

Designing water and wastewater treatment systems requires a holistic understanding of chemical and biological processes, as well as their interactions with flow dynamics. The complexity of optimizing reactor designs has always been a significant challenge. However, recent advances in computational power have made computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools like Fluent and OpenFOAM more popular, becoming indispensable in both academic research and industrial reactor optimization efforts. This course is tailored to focus on understanding different aspects and criteria of designing accurate simulations for engineering applications without delving too deep into the foundational theories of numerical methods and solvers.
