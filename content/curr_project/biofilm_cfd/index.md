In our lab, we develop advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to simulate the complex dynamics of biofilms in various flow environments. These simulations enable us to capture biofilm growth, structural changes, and interactions with surrounding fluids at fine scales, revealing insights that are challenging to obtain experimentally.
