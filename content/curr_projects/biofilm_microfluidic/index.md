Our lab leverages microfluidic experiments to study biofilms, utilizing micro-scale channels and controlled environments to mimic
natural fluid flow conditions. These experiments allow us to observe biofilm formation, growth, and behavior under various
environmental factors, providing a detailed view of interactions within confined spaces. By leveraging advanced imaging and data
analysis, we aim to uncover fundamental principles of biofilm dynamics that have applications in fields ranging from environmental
engineering to energy storage.
