# # Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: I am a Ph.D. student who will be starting in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas A&M University in Fall 2023. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering from the University of Seoul.

# My research interests lie in the multi-physics and multi-scale interactions that occur in hydro-ecosystems. Through the application of physics and mathematics, I aim to provide insightful solutions to issues related to water, the environment, and energy, with the ultimate goal of contributing to human welfare.
