I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Texas A&M University. My research focuses on optimizing water, resource recovery technologies, and energy storage using a multiscale approach.

Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was a postdoctoral research in Energy and Science Engineering at Stanford University. I received my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Stanford University, where I also received two M.S. degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering and Computational and Mathematical Engineering. Prior to that, I completed my B.Eng with First Class Honors in Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore.

My expertise lies in combining modeling, experiments, and simulations to develop and optimize novel technologies from the lab to
commercial scales, with a particular emphasis on water and resource recovery, as well as energy storage. By utilizing a multiscale
approach, I am able to explore and optimize the various aspects of these systems, ranging from fundamental biology, chemistry and
physics to engineering design.

Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of sustainable solutions to pressing environmental challenges, while also advancing the state of the art in engineering and science.
