      <description>&lt;p&gt;Membrane-based desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis and membrane distillation, have become widely used for water recovery in recent years. However, these processes face challenges such as membrane fouling due to polarization caused by concentration and temperature gradients. In this project, we aimed to address this challenge by using high-fidelity simulations to gain a comprehensive understanding of mass and heat transport in membrane-based desalination systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our simulations, we investigated the effects of various parameters on the transport properties of these systems, including
operating conditions, and reactor designs. Our findings will provide quantitative guidelines for the design and operation of membrane-based desalination processes to improve their efficiency and minimize fouling. Specifically, we provide insights into optimal operating conditions to reduce fouling and polarization effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our project provides a valuable contribution to the field of membrane-based desalination, offering a deeper understanding of mass and heat transport in these systems and providing practical guidelines for improving their design and operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- In recent years, membrane has been widely used in different technologies to recover water through desalination. Typical processes
include but not limited to reverse osmosis and membrane distillation. One challenge associated with these membrane-based
technolgoies is membrane fouling due to polarization (both concentration and temperature). In this project, we employed
high-fidelity simulations to understand the mass and heat transport in these systems to provide quantitative guidelines for design
and operation.  --&gt;

      <title>Energy-positive wastewater treatment systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Staged Anaerobic Fluidized-bed Membrane Bioreactor (SAF-MBR) is a promising technology for reducing the energy intensity of domestic wastewater treatment by using anaerobic microorganisms to convert organics into methane in the absence of aeration. However, the hydrodynamic processes related to flow-particle and particle-particle interactions induced by the moving particles in the SAF-MBR are poorly understood, which hinders its design and operational practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, we have developed a collocated particle resolved simulation (PRS) using the immersed boundary method (IBM) to accurately quantify the fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions in a fluidized-bed reactor. Through our simulations, we have investigated the effect of particle Reynolds number and found that an intermediate particle Reynolds number regime exists where the combined effect of flow and collisions is optimal, maximizing both mixing in the AFBR and membrane scouring in the P-MBR.&lt;/p&gt;

      Hypothetical impacts of upflow velocity and porosity on fluidized-bed reactor modeling, design and operation.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also determined that the design of fluidized beds critically depends on the Archimedes number, which combines the effect of particle and fluid properties. Our simulation results show that particles with an Archimedes number greater than roughly 1000 should be used to avoid flow short-circuiting due to clusters in the AFBR and reduced membrane scouring due to ineffective collisions in the P-MBR.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our simulations reveal that segregated layers of particles behave identically to their corresponding monodispersed fluidized bed layers, but the transition region between the two segregated layers cannot be described as a simple superposition of the two segregated layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the hydrodynamics of the SAF-MBR and can help improve its design and operation for more efficient and effective wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Recently, the Staged Anaerobic Fluidized-bed Membrane Bioreactor (SAF-MBR), which consists of an anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor
(AFBR) and a particle-sparged membrane bioreactor (P-MBR), has been developed to reduce the energy intensity of domestic wastewater
treatment by using anaerobic microorganisms that convert organics into methane in the absence of aeration. While this has the
potential to transform domestic wastewater treatment into an energy positive process, the moving particles in the SAF-MBR induce
hydrodynamic processes related to flow-particle and particle-particle interactions that are poorly understood. With a better
understanding of hydrodynamics, better design and operational practices can be developed.

&lt;/video&gt;


To overcome this, a collocated particle resolved simulation (PRS) using the immersed boundary method (IBM) is developed to
accurately quantify the fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions in a fluidized-bed reactor.We first investigate the effect
of particle Reynolds number which is essentially a nondimensional flow rate that controls the bed expansion. Results imply the
existence of an intermediate particle Reynolds number regime at which the combined effect of flow and collisions is optimal and both
mixing in the AFBR and membrane scouring in the P-MBR are expected to be maximized.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


While the Reynolds number is a critical parameter, the design of fluidized beds depends critically on the Archimedes number that
combines the effect of particle and fluid properties. Simulation results reveal that particles with Archimedes number greater than
roughly 1000 should be used to avoid flow short-circuiting due to clusters in the AFBR and reduced membrane scouring due to
ineffective collisions in the P-MBR. In industrial applications, fluidized beds typically contain particles of different sizes that
tend to segregate into layers in which the particle size increases moving
upward.

      <title>Nitrous oxide recovery from sidestream wastewater</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The release of nitrogen from wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to eutrophication and the formation of oxygen-depleted zones, which can have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Conventional nitrogen removal processes typically require a large amount of energy for aeration, reducing power, and disposal of waste biosolids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research aims to address these issues through the development of shortcut nitrogen removal processes, which involve the
oxidation of ammonium to nitrite, followed by the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide using either heterotrophic denitrifiers. To
recover energy while removing nitrogen from wastewater, we have developed a dual-stressor partial nitritation process with timed
alkali addition, followed by the Coupled Aerobic-anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO) process, which recovers nitrogen in
the form of nitrous oxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has several advantages over conventional nitrogen removal methods. The dual-stressor partial nitritation process is robust and can operate at high ammonia concentrations, while the CANDO process enables the recovery of nitrogen in the form of nitrous oxide, which can be combusted with methane to generate energy. In addition, this process requires less energy input than conventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the use of nitrous oxide in energy generation has significant potential for sustainable wastewater treatment, and we hope that our research will contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable processes for nitrogen removal from wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Release of reactive nitrogen from wastewater into natural water bodies can stimulate eutrophica-
tion and create oxygen-depleted zones. Conventional nitrogen removal processes need significant energy input for aeration, require
reducing power, and generate large amount of waste biosolids for disposal. These issues can be addressed through shortcut nitrogen
removal processes in which ammonium is oxidized to nitrite, and nitrite is reduced to dinitrogen gas with either heterotrophic or
autotrophic denitrifiers. To recover energy while removing nitrogen from wastewater, we first developed a robust dual-stressor
partial nitritation process with timed alkali addition and then Coupled Aerobic-anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO)
process to recover nitrogen in the form of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide has been proven to improve energy generation when combusted
with methane. --&gt;</description>
