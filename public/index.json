The need to properly resolve spatial and temporal scales spanning multiple orders of magnitude pushes the limits of both our theoretical models as well as our computational capabilities. Rigorous upscaling techniques enable efficient computation while bounding/tracking errors and helping to make informed cost-accuracy tradeoffs. The biggest challenges arise when the applicability conditions of upscaled models break down. Here, we present a non-intrusive two-way (iterative bottom-up top-down) coupled hybrid model, applied to thermal runaway in battery packs, that combines fine-scale and upscaled equations in the same numerical simulation to achieve predictive accuracy while limiting computational costs. First, we develop two methods with different orders of accuracy to enforce continuity at the coupling boundary. Then, we derive weak (i.e., variational) formulations of the fine-scale and upscaled governing equations for finite element (FE) discretization and numerical implementation in FEniCS. We demonstrate that hybrid simulations can accurately predict the average temperature fields within error bounds determined apriori by homogenization theory. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of the hybrid algorithm against fine-scale simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Non-intrusive Hybrid Scheme for Multiscale Heat Transfer: Thermal Runaway in a Battery Pack","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Link to the publication\n","date":1694476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694476800,"objectID":"4eac61a8331308f5404b0e5d96325609","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/2023-09-12-jcos_hybrid/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-09-12-jcos_hybrid/","section":"news","summary":"Link to the publication\n","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Non-intrusive hybrid scheme for multiscale heat transfer: Thermal runaway in a battery pack\" has been published in Journal of Computational Science.","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our group officially starts with the first dinner at Velvet Taco!

However, entrance effects in lab-scale systems can significantly impact heat, mass and momentum transfer in the reactor, therefore affect the accuracy of the developed experimental Sherwood and Nusselt correlations. Here, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using OpenFOAM are performed to understand the effects of right-angled bends and inlet design on flow dynamics, temperature and concentration polarization in MD systems. Simulation results show that the presence of right-angled bends and inlets with sudden expansions lead to the formation of Dean vortices. Dean vortices enhance perpendicular mixing in MD systems and reduce both temperature and concentration polarization. Temperature and concentration polarization coefficients in MD systems with right-angled bends and inlets with sudden expansions vary significantly for the same volumetric flow rate. Our studies show that lab-scale systems with the same volumetric flow rate but different designs lead to significantly different Nusselt and Sherwood correlations. This study demonstrates the importance of CFD-informed design of lab- scale systems to minimize entrance effects and suppress Dean vortices for consistent model development and calibration across multiple scales.","tags":[],"title":"Understanding Flow Dynamics in Membrane Distillation: Effects of Reactor Design on Polarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Link to the publication\n","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674691200,"objectID":"28928364a02b849ef9ff874e174f8b13","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/2023-01-26-lsgcibm-paper/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-01-26-lsgcibm-paper/","section":"news","summary":"Link to the publication\n","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"A level-set immersed boundary method for reactive transport in complex topologies with moving interfaces\" has been published in Journal of Computational Physics.","type":"news"},{"authors":["Mehrdad Yousefzadeh","Yinuo \"Noah\" Yao","Ilenia Battiato"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1673308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673388518,"objectID":"d71b2f3551e34bf6470e4414dee4ffe7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/yao-2023-rg-gcibm-ls/","publishdate":"2023-01-10T22:08:38.202742Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yao-2023-rg-gcibm-ls/","section":"publication","summary":"A simulation framework based on the level-set and the immersed boundary methods (LS-IBM) has been developed for reactive transport problems in porous media involving a moving solid-fluid interface.

Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method for particle Reynolds numbers of 20–70 with an Archimedes number of 23 600. Two different flow regimes were identified as a function of the particle Reynolds number. For low particle Reynolds numbers ( $20 ), the porosity is relatively low and the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle collisions that produce anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. The relative importance of hydrodynamic effects increases with increasing particle Reynolds number, leading to a minimized anisotropy in the particle velocity fluctuations at an intermediate particle Reynolds number. For high particle Reynolds numbers ( $Re_p \u003e 40$ ), the particle dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic effects, leading to decreasing and more anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. A sharp increase in the anisotropy occurs when the particle Reynolds number increases from 40 to 50, corresponding to a transition from a regime in which collision and hydrodynamic effects are equally important (regime 1) to a hydrodynamic-dominated regime (regime 2). The results imply an optimum particle Reynolds number of roughly 40 for the investigated Archimedes number of 23 600 at which mixing in the reactor is expected to peak, which is consistent with reactor studies showing peak performance at a similar particle Reynolds number and with a similar Archimedes number.

Recently, the Staged Anaerobic Fluidized-bed Membrane Bioreactor (SAF-MBR), which consists of an anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR) and a particle-sparged membrane bioreactor (P-MBR), has been developed to reduce the energy intensity of domestic wastewater treatment by using anaerobic microorganisms that convert organics into methane in the absence of aeration. While this has the potential to transform domestic wastewater treatment into an energy positive process, the moving particles in the SAF-MBR induce hydrodynamic processes related to flow-particle and particle-particle interactions that are poorly understood. These processes are critical for biological treatment because they enhance mass transfer and mixing in the AFBR and can prevent membrane damage and fouling by optimizing effective collisions (i.e., scouring) in the P-MBR. With a better understanding of hydrodynamics, better design and operational practices can be developed.\nA collocated particle resolved simulation (PRS) using the immersed boundary method (IBM) is developed to accurately quantify the fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions in a fluidized-bed reactor. Simulations of particle fluidization/suspension are then used to study the effect of particle Reynolds number, Archimedes number and bidispersivity, or a fluidized bed with two particle sizes. The simulated conditions are relevant to fluidized-bed reactors used in wastewater treatment.\nThe particle Reynolds number, which is essentially a nondimensional flow rate, is a critical operational parameter that controls the bed expansion which ultimately affects both treatment and membrane fouling control efficiency. Various studies have shown that optimal performance of wastewater treatment typically occurs at an intermediate particle Reynolds number or bed expansion, yet these results have not been verified quantitatively. Using results from our simulations, we identified two different flow regimes as a function of the particle Reynolds number. For low particle Reynolds numbers, the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle collisions, while for high particle Reynolds numbers, the particle dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic effects. This implies an intermediate particle Reynolds number regime at which the combined effect of flow and collisions is optimal and both mixing in the AFBR and membrane scouring in the P-MBR are expected to be maximized. The results also suggest the need to develop a biofilm detachment model that depends on particle collisions at low particle Reynolds numbers and one that depends on hydrodynamically-induced shear stresses at high particle Reynolds numbers.\nWhile the Reynolds number is a critical parameter for optimal fluidized-bed operation, design of fluidized beds depends critically on the Archimedes number, which is a measure of the relative effects of particle buoyancy to viscosity. Previous studies suggest particles with relatively low Archimedes number (100 - 1000) should be used to maximize mass transfer. However, our results suggest that particles with low Archimedes number tend to form clusters due to ineffective collisions, likely resulting in flow short-circuiting due to clusters in the AFBR and reduced membrane scouring due to ineffective collisions in the P-MBR. Therefore, fluidized beds should not be operated at Archimedes numbers smaller than roughly 1000.\nIn industrial applications, fluidized beds typically contain particles of different sizes that tend to segregate into layers in which the particle size increases moving upward. Our simulations with two particle sizes show that the two segregated layers behave identically as they would in their corresponding monodispersed fluidized bed layers. However, the transition region between the two segregated layers cannot be described as a simple average between the two segregated layers. For example, the interaction between large and small particles in the transition region leads to particle fluctuations that exceed those in the upper layer at high particle Reynolds numbers.\nWith the insights gained from simulating the hydrodynamics in fluidized beds, operating the SAF-MBR at intermediate particle Reynolds numbers in which momentum transfer is the most efficient is likely to lead to optimized biological reactions in the AFBR and maximized membrane scouring effects in the P-MBR. To avoid particle clustering that leads to both flow short-circuiting and ineffective membrane scouring, the results suggest that particles with Archimedes numbers greater than 1000 are recommended. However, owing to larger energy costs associated with fluidizing beds with high Archimedes number particles, the SAF-MBR should be operated at intermediate Archimedes numbers of ~1000 - 5000 to ensure membrane scour while avoiding higher pumping costs.  For a SAF-MBR with non-uniform particle size distributions, the bed expansion is not strongly correlated to the volume fraction or porosity of mean or small particle sizes because most of the expansion may be due to the smaller particles. To overcome this, reactor design and operation should be based on either the largest or each dominant particle size.\nIn the future, experimental validation of the simulation results is recommended. Due to limitations with computational methods, biological reactions are not included in the present simulations. To quantify mass transfer efficiency, new computational methods should be developed. Studies of other design and operation parameters such as particle sphericity and nozzle design are needed. Particle sphericity affects the particle dynamics such as mixing, mass transfer and fluidization while turbulence generated from nozzles is likely to cause membrane damage.

To evaluate the validity of superposition of monodispersed reactor behavior, we evaluate the effects of bidispersity by comparing three-dimensional liquid-solid monodispersed and segregated bidipsersed fluidized beds. Simulations were conducted using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with direct forcing in a periodic domain and with particle Reynolds numbers of 20-70 based on the largest particle diameter. We show that the volume fraction, kinematic wave speed, particle velocity fluctuations, and collisional and hydrodynamic stresses in the segregated layers of a bidispersed fluidized bed can be well approximated by the corresponding properties of a monodispersed fluidized bed. In the transition region between the layers, only the volume fraction and collision stresses monotonically decrease with height. At low Reynolds numbers, particle velocity fluctuations in the upper layers are the largest. As the particle Reynolds number increases, particle velocity fluctuations in the transition and lower layers become the largest sequentially. At intermediate particle Reynolds numbers, the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition region are greater than those in the upper and lower layers. As the particle Reynolds number increases, the difference between the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition layer and the two layers becomes more significant. This work demonstrates that, despite the clear segregation into layers that behave like monodispersed beds, the transition region is governed by complex bidispersed mechanisms that cannot be explained in terms of the particle behavior in the segregated layers. Overall, particle dynamics of the segregated layers in the bidispersed fluidized bed can be approximated with the corresponding monodispersed layers. The result implies that industrial applications such as wastewater treatment performance in bidispersed or polydispersed fluidized beds can be predicted with results from past numerical or experimental studies of monodispersed fluidized beds.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of the properties of segregated layers in a bidispersed fluidized bed to those of a monodispersed fluidized bed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo \"Noah\" Yao","Craig S.

We find that cluster formation is strongly dependent on the Archimedes number but weakly dependent on the volume fraction for concentrated suspensions. Particles in low Ar cases are characterized by less frequent but long-lived clusters, resulting in higher hindered settling, while high Ar cases consist of more frequent but short-lived clusters, leading to reduced hindered settling. By quantifying the effects of collisions on the hydrodynamic fluctuations, we show that the lifespan of clusters for the low Ar cases is longer because particles are subject to appreciable wake interactions without collisions. On the other hand, clusters for high Ar cases are broken before being subject to appreciable wake interactions due to frequent collisions, leading to a shorter cluster lifespan. The results imply that there exists an Ar for particles in fluidized bed reactors that can reduce short circuiting due to clustering and enhance performance by maximizing flow–particle interactions. This result is consistent with existing reactor studies demonstrating that optimal particle diameters and Ar values correspond to cases with short-lived clusters, although more thorough experimental studies are needed.","tags":[],"title":"The effects of particle clustering on hindered settling in high-concentration particle suspensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo \"Noah\" Yao","Zhiyue Wang","Craig S.

Because ammonia oxidation is well-studied, tests of CANDO to date have focused on N2O production in anaerobic/anoxic sequencing batch reactors. In these reactors, nitrogen is provided as nitrite; PHA is produced from acetate or other dissolved COD, and PHA oxidation is coupled to N2O production from nitrite. In a pilot-scale study, N2O recovery was affected by COD/N ratio, total cycle time, and relative time periods for PHA synthesis and N2O production. In follow-up bench-scale studies, different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters. Increasing COD/N ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration. Shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of PHA and improved its utilization. Efficient PHA synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high N2O production in the anoxic phase. Shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of N2O to N2. By shortening both phases, total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h. This optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations, increased N2O yields (from 71 to 87%), increased N loading rates (from 0.1 to 0.25 kg N/m3-d), and shorter hydraulic residence times (from 10 to 2 days). Long-term changes in operational performance for the different bioreactor systems tested were generally similar despite significant differences in microbial community structure. Long-term operation at short anaerobic phases selected for a glycogen-accumulating community dominated by a Defluviicoccus-related strain.","tags":[],"title":"Nitrogen removal as nitrous oxide for energy recovery: Increased process stability and high nitrous yields at short hydraulic residence times","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kok Kwang Ng","Xueqing Shi","Yinuo \"Noah\" Yao","How Yong Ng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1414800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414800000,"objectID":"a73cd3b98b48aee405e528ee8415e49f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ng-2014-ol-entrapped/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:38.840063Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ng-2014-ol-entrapped/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, a bio-entrapped membrane reactor (BEMR) and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) were evaluated to study the organic treatment performance of pharmaceutical wastewater. The influences of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and salinity were also studied. The conventional biomass in the BEMR cannot tolerate well of the hypersaline conditions, resulting in total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 54.2-68.0%. On the other hand, microorganisms in the SMSMBR, which was seeded from coastal shore, strived and was able to degrade the complex organic in the presence of salt effectively, achieving 74.7-90.9% of TCOD removal efficiencies. Marine microorganisms able to degrade recalcitrant compounds and utilize hydrocarbon compounds were found in the SMSMBR, which resulted in higher organic removal efficiency than the BEMR. However, specific nitrifying activity decreased and inhibited due to the saline effect that led to poor ammonia nitrogen removal.","tags":[],"title":"Bio-entrapped membrane reactor and salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater: treatment performance and microbial communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
